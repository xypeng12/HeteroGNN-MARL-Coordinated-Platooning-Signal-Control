# HeteroGNN-MARL for Coordinated Platooning and Traffic Signal Control

Implementation of **Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HeteroGNN)-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)** for **coordinated platooning and traffic signal control**, developed using **Ray RLlib** and **SUMO**.  

---

## Features
- **Heterogeneous GNN** for modeling both platoons and traffic signals in a unified graph.
- **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning** for collaborative decision-making across agents.
- **Coordinated control** integrating vehicle platooning with adaptive traffic signal timing.
- **SUMO-based simulation** for realistic traffic modeling and evaluation.
- **Ray RLlib framework** for scalable multi-agent training and evaluation.
